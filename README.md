The pizza sales dataset is a CSV file which provides data of a pizza place for the year 2015.these tables contains details like name, size, category, order_id, quantity and price.

DATA CLEANING:

this is the first step I started with after successfully loading my dataset into Power BI. The following are the processes I used in cleaning my dataset
1.Remove Errors: I removed all incorrect values from the tables to ensure that data is consistency.
2.Remove Duplicates: I ensure that there are no repeated rows in the table.
3.Use First Row as Headers.

DATA MODELLING:

After ensuring my data is clean, then I performed data modelling.

DATA ANALYSING AND VISUALIZATION:

1.Annual Sales: The total sales for the whole year 2015 of the pizza place was $817,860. Where July had the highest sales followed by May, March and November while September and October had the least sales.
2.Ordered Pizzas by Category and Size: The most ordered pizza is the Thai Chicken Pizza where Classic and Supreme are the most ordered category and the large sized pizza is the most preferred one.
3.Pizza Trends: In terms of daily trend Friday is the busiest day during the week and the hourly trend 12.00 and 13.00 are the busiest hours of the day.

BUSINESS VIEW:

1.Increasing and promoting the large and classic pizza as they are more preferred that the rest of the size and category.
2.Marketing the least preferred pizza like “The Brie Carre Pizza, Mediterranean Pizza and The Spinach Pesto Pizza” by providing discounts and offers, also considering renewing the recipes of these pizzas.
3.Increasing staffs on the most busiest hours and days to cater all customers efficiently, also considering adjustment in operational hours specifically on the slower periods by ensuring resources are allocated during peak hours.
